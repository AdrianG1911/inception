Okay, great! With Nginx set up to handle HTTPS and serve static files, the next big step is indeed integrating WordPress.

Here's a breakdown of how you'll typically set up the WordPress part, keeping in mind it will run in its own Docker container and Nginx will act as a reverse proxy for PHP requests.

Core Concepts for WordPress with Nginx:

WordPress Files: You need the WordPress core files. These will reside in a volume that both your Nginx container (to serve static assets like images, CSS, JS directly) and your WordPress container (to execute PHP) can access.

PHP-FPM: WordPress is written in PHP. Nginx itself doesn't execute PHP. It needs to pass PHP requests to a PHP processor. The standard way to do this is using PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager). Your WordPress Docker container will run PHP-FPM.

PHP-FPM: WordPress is written in PHP. Nginx itself doesn't execute PHP. It needs to pass PHP requests to a PHP processor. The standard way to do this is using PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager). Your WordPress Docker container will run PHP-FPM.

Database: WordPress needs a database (MariaDB in your Inception project) to store all its content, settings, users, etc.

Nginx Configuration Update: Your Nginx configuration will need to be updated to:

Know where the WordPress files are (the root directive).

Identify PHP requests (e.g., files ending in .php).

Pass these PHP requests to the PHP-FPM service running in your WordPress container.

Handle WordPress's "pretty permalinks" correctly.

Steps to Set Up the WordPress Part:

1. Prepare Your WordPress Dockerfile (or use an official image):

You'll have a Dockerfile for your WordPress service. A common approach is to use an official WordPress image that already includes PHP-FPM.

Example using wordpress:fpm-alpine (recommended for Inception):
This image is lightweight and comes with PHP-FPM ready to go.

# In your wordpress/Dockerfile (or similar)
FROM wordpress:fpm-alpine

# (Optional) Install any extra PHP extensions if needed, though unlikely for basic WordPress
# RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql mysqli && docker-php-ext-enable pdo_mysql

# (Optional) Copy custom configurations or scripts
# COPY ./conf/www.conf /usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
# COPY --chown=www-data:www-data ./tools/wp-config-create.sh /usr/local/bin/wp-config-create.sh
# RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wp-config-create.sh

# The official image sets up /var/www/html as the working directory and volume.
# WordPress files will be downloaded into /var/www/html on first run if the directory is empty.

# Expose the PHP-FPM port (default is 9000)
EXPOSE 9000

# (Optional) If you have a script to create wp-config.php or perform other setup
# ENTRYPOINT [ "wp-config-create.sh" ]
# CMD ["php-fpm"]


wp-config.php: The official WordPress images are smart. If you provide database credentials via environment variables (see Docker Compose section), they will often create the wp-config.php file for you or guide you through the web-based setup.

Alternatively, you can create a script (like wp-config-create.sh mentioned above) that uses wp-cli (you'd need to install it in the Dockerfile) or sed to populate a wp-config-sample.php with your database details and save it as wp-config.php. This is a common Inception requirement to automate setup.

2. Update Your docker-compose.yml:

You'll add a service for WordPress and one for MariaDB.

version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    build:
      context: ./requirements/nginx # Path to your Nginx Dockerfile and conf
    container_name: nginx
    ports:

    expose: # Only expose to other containers in the network, not the host
      - "9000"
    environment: # These are used by the official WordPress image to configure wp-config.php
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mariadb      # Service name of your MariaDB container
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: ${DB_USER}   # From your .env file
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASS} # From your .env file
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: ${DB_NAME}   # From your .env file
      # WORDPRESS_TABLE_PREFIX: wp_ # Optional
    depends_on:
      - mariadb                     # WordPress needs the database to be up

    container_name: mariadb
    volumes:
      - mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql # Persistent storage for database
    expose: # Only expose to other containers
      - "3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_ROOT_PASS} # From your .env file
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${DB_NAME}          # From your .env file
      MYSQL_USER: ${DB_USER}              # From your .env file
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASS}          # From your .env file
    networks:
      - inception_network
    restart: always

Key wordpress service details:

build: Points to your WordPress Dockerfile directory.

volumes: wordpress_files:/var/www/html is crucial. This volume will store the WordPress installation. Nginx also mounts this same volume to the same path (/var/www/html) so it can serve static files directly.

expose: ["9000"]: PHP-FPM in the WordPress container listens on port 9000 by default. expose makes it accessible to other services on the same Docker network (like Nginx) but not directly from your host machine.

environment: These variables are used by the official WordPress image to automatically configure wp-config.php or to pre-fill the installation screen.

depends_on: [mariadb]: Ensures MariaDB starts before WordPress attempts to connect.

Key mariadb service details:

volumes: mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql ensures your database data persists even if the container stops/restarts.

environment: These variables are used by the MariaDB image to initialize the database, create a user, and set passwords.

Volumes:

wordpress_files: This named volume will hold your WordPress core files, themes, plugins, and uploads.

mariadb_data: This named volume will hold your database files.

The driver_opts with type: none, device: ..., and o: bind creates bind mounts, linking directories on your host machine to directories inside the containers. This is common for Inception to easily inspect/manage data. Make sure the host paths (/home/${USER}/data/...) exist or are created.

Networks: Using a custom bridge network (inception_network) is good practice for isolation and allows services to refer to each other by their service names (e.g., mariadb as the DB host).

3. Update Your Nginx Configuration (default.conf or similar):

Now, modify your Nginx configuration file to handle PHP requests and WordPress permalinks.

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost your.domain.com; # Add your actual domain if you have one

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

    root /var/www/html; # This is where WordPress files are (shared volume)
    index index.php index.html index.htm; # Add index.php

    location / {
        # try_files $uri $uri/ =404; # Old version for static sites
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args; # Crucial for WordPress permalinks
    }

    # Add this location block to process PHP files
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params; # Includes common FastCGI parameters
        fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; # 'wordpress' is the service name from docker-compose.yml
                                     # 9000 is the port PHP-FPM listens on in the WordPress container
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        # fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info; # Sometimes useful
    }

    # (Optional) Deny access to sensitive files
    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
    location = /xmlrpc.php {
        deny all; # Or limit access if you use it
    }
    location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }
}

root /var/www/html;: This should now point to the directory where WordPress is installed (which is the shared volume).

index index.php index.html index.htm;: index.php is added and prioritized because WordPress uses index.php as its front controller.

location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args; }: This is very important for WordPress. It ensures that if a requested URL doesn't directly map to a file or directory, the request is passed to WordPress's index.php with the query arguments. This allows WordPress to handle its "pretty permalinks" (e.g., yourdomain.com/my-sample-post/ instead of yourdomain.com/?p=123).

location ~ \.php$ { ... }:

This block matches any request ending in .php.

include fastcgi_params;: Loads a standard set of FastCGI parameters.

fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;: This is the key line. It tells Nginx to forward the PHP request to the service named wordpress (from your docker-compose.yml) on port 9000 (where PHP-FPM is listening inside the WordPress container).

fastcgi_index index.php;: If the URI is just a directory, and it's a PHP request, use index.php.

fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;: This tells PHP-FPM the absolute path of the PHP script to execute on the filesystem within the PHP-FPM container. Since both Nginx and WordPress mount the shared volume to /var/www/html, $document_root (which is /var/www/html from Nginx's perspective) correctly maps to the script's location for PHP-FPM.

4. Build and Run:

Make sure you have a .env file in the root of your Inception project with your database credentials:

# .env
USER=your_host_username # Replace with your actual host username for volume paths

DB_NAME=wordpress_db
DB_USER=wp_user
DB_PASS=secure_password
DB_ROOT_PASS=even_more_secure_root_password

Create the host directories for the bind mounts if they don't exist:

mkdir -p /home/${USER}/data/wordpress
mkdir -p /home/${USER}/data/mariadb
# Or use the actual username if ${USER} isn't resolving correctly in your shell
# mkdir -p /home/your_username/data/wordpress
# mkdir -p /home/your_username/data/mariadb

docker-compose up --build -d
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

--build: Forces Docker to rebuild your images if Dockerfiles have changed.

-d: Runs in detached mode.

5. WordPress Installation:

Open your browser and go to https://localhost (or https://your.domain.com if you configured DNS).

You should be greeted by the WordPress installation screen.

If you provided the WORDPRESS_DB_* environment variables correctly in docker-compose.yml and are using an official WordPress image, wp-config.php might already be configured, or these fields will be pre-filled.

Complete the WordPress installation (site title, admin username, password, email).

Troubleshooting/Verification:

Logs: docker-compose logs nginx, docker-compose logs wordpress, docker-compose logs mariadb.

Connectivity:

From Nginx container to WordPress: docker exec -it nginx ping wordpress

From WordPress container to MariaDB: docker exec -it wordpress ping mariadb

PHP-FPM: Ensure PHP-FPM is running in the WordPress container. docker exec -it wordpress ps aux | grep php-fpm.

File Permissions: The wordpress_files volume should be writable by the user PHP-FPM runs as (usually www-data) inside the WordPress container. The official WordPress images usually handle this.

wp-config.php: If WordPress can't connect to the database, double-check the contents of /var/www/html/wp-config.php inside the WordPress container (docker exec -it wordpress cat /var/www/html/wp-config.php). Ensure DB_HOST is mariadb (or your MariaDB service name).

This comprehensive setup should get your WordPress site running behind Nginx with SSL in your Inception project! Remember that specific Inception requirements might ask you to automate the wp-config.php creation more explicitly, often using a script with wp-cli or sed.
Database: WordPress needs a database (MariaDB in your Inception project) to store all its content, settings, users, etc.
