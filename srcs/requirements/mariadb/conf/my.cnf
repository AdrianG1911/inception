# This section configures the MariaDB SERVER (the daemon).

# Tell the server where to CREATE the socket.
socket = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Tell the server to listen on all network interfaces for WordPress.

# This section configures CLIENT applications (like mysql, mysqladmin).

# This section is for newer MariaDB-specific client tools.
# It's good practice to include it for full compatibility.
